To add a AACon web service, go to JABA2 project and execute aacon-ws-client build task. 
put the aacon-ws-client into website folder.

Also if any changes were done to ws.client.AAConWSClient then the whole class must 
be put into website root. 

Also any changes done to the JABA datamodel, the datamodel javadoc must be 
regenerated and put into doc folder. Then, AACon javadoc must be regenerated
and pointed to datamodel javadoc for linkage. 

If any public methods have been updated/moved/renamed AACon javadoc must be updated. 

Finally, javadoc from doc folder must be moved to website/javadoc folder. 

After move but before commit do not forget to remove SVN subfolders and cleanup

parent folder. 

When updating do not update web.xml and sun descriptors in www-aacon tomcat instance!

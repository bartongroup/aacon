TODO: 

1) WrapperClass2 should not throw exceptions if no parameters were provided

2) If WrapperClass2 is supposed to be main application entry point, it should print help 
on to what parameters it supports/expects. 

3) The name of the class should be more telling about its functions

4) No paths should be hard coded

5) All the data which is used should be available within the project. (e.g. "/homes/agolicz/alignments/alignment1")

Comments on ColumnCollectionShortList: 

6) Methods names should be converted to enumeration (java enum). 
cols.calculationInitializtion(kabat, jores, schneider, shenkin, gerstein, taylorNoGaps, taylorGaps, zvelibil, karlin, armon, thompson, lancet, mirny, williamson, landgraf, sander, valdar);
are these the list of supported methods? 

7) Can initialisation be completed when a particular calculation method is requested? 

8) Can the result of calculation be stored in memory and if required be written into a file?
They should not be written into a file to start with. 

9) Please make sure your methods produce right values. I made a MethodTester class, 
there are 3 sequences there, assume that they represent an alignment. Calculate values 
for each method manually, and compare them with what your method gives you. 
Do you think you can do manual calculation for 3 colument with 3 AA each?   

10) Please indicate which classes are not part of your resulting system, for example by prefixing them
with underscore. 

11) General recommendation - avoid methods/constructors with more then 5 parameters! 
Talk to me if you feel you cannot get away without them.

12) Why AminoAcidMatrix has a constructor with 10 chars? Does it have to be 10 chars? 
Would not it be easier to accept an array of chars of arbitrary length?
Similar goes for Column class. 

13) If your expected value is defined to the third point after the comma, e.g. -2.072,
then, the difference between expected and actual value must be lesser then 0.001 
In other words you can only expect the value to be rounded to -2.073 or -2.071,
thus delta should be 0.001. Please do not use 0.1 as a uniform delta everywhere in 
your test cases.

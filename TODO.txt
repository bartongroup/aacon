TODO: 


DONE: Wrapper class is not an application entry point any more. There is an ConservationClient class now.
1) WrapperClass2 should not throw exceptions if no parameters were provided DONE

DONE 2) If WrapperClass2 is supposed to be main application entry point, it should print help 
on to what parameters it supports/expects.  

DONE 3) The name of the class should be more telling about its functions 

DONE 4) No paths should be hard coded 

NOT DONE YET 5) All the data which is used should be available within the project. (e.g. "/homes/agolicz/alignments/alignment1") 

Comments on ColumnCollectionShortList: 
This class is not used any more.

DONE 6) Methods names should be converted to enumeration (java enum). 
cols.calculationInitializtion(kabat, jores, schneider, shenkin, gerstein, taylorNoGaps, taylorGaps, zvelibil, karlin, armon, thompson, lancet, mirny, williamson, landgraf, sander, valdar);
are these the list of supported methods? 

DONE 7) Can initialisation be completed when a particular calculation method is requested? 

DONE 8) Can the result of calculation be stored in memory and if required be written into a file? 
They should not be written into a file to start with. 


DONE  9) Please make sure your methods produce right values. I made a MethodTester class, 
: Tester has three column with three examples. Two extreme(column fully conserved and all but one gaps) 
and one semiconserved column.
there are 3 sequences there, assume that they represent an alignment. Calculate values 
for each method manually, and compare them with what your method gives you. 
Do you think you can do manual calculation for 3 colument with 3 AA each?   

DONE 10) Please indicate which classes are not part of your resulting system, for example by prefixing them 
with underscore. 

11) General recommendation - avoid methods/constructors with more then 5 parameters! 
Talk to me if you feel you cannot get away without them. 


NEW

12) Why AminoAcidMatrix has a constructor with 10 chars? Does it have to be 10 chars? 
Would not it be easier to accept an array of chars of arbitrary length?
Similar goes for Column class. DONE
(I've changed one of the constructors taking chars as arguments - that one now accepts array of any length, there is another constructor taking chars but this one is used just in test files but I'll keep it as it is for now since it is used for tests only)

13) If your expected value is defined to the third point after the comma, e.g. -2.072,
then, the difference between expected and actual value must be lesser then 0.001 
In other words you can only expect the value to be rounded to -2.073 or -2.071,
thus delta should be 0.001. Please do not use 0.1 as a uniform delta everywhere in 
your test cases. DONE

14) Conservation client help is not sufficiently detailed. From the information below
I cannot figure out how to run the thing. DONE
   
Method names, output format, input and output file paths are required.
Methods not provided
Format not provided
Input file path not provided.
Output file path not provided.

15) Execution of the ConservationClient with no parameters leads to exception  DONE
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:103)
	at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:66)
	at compbio.conservation.ConservationClient.<init>(ConservationClient.java:213)
	at compbio.conservation.ConservationClient.main(ConservationClient.java:272)

16) According to java naming conventions Enum constrains should be defined in capital case DONE
with underscore as a separator between words. Please read on java enum naming convention. 

17) ConservationClient.scores should not be statically defined. As if it is left DONE(not defined statically)
like it is only one client can be run at one time. This is ok for the command line 
client, but we will need to be able to execute conservation prediction methods from java too.  

18) I suggest Format to be defined as enum too.  WILL DO as soon as I finish ConservationFormatter and I will know what formats are supported(will be dine today)

TODO: 


DONE: Wrapper class is not an application entry point any more. There is an ConservationClient class now.
1) WrapperClass2 should not throw exceptions if no parameters were provided DONE

DONE 2) If WrapperClass2 is supposed to be main application entry point, it should print help 
on to what parameters it supports/expects.  

DONE 3) The name of the class should be more telling about its functions 

DONE 4) No paths should be hard coded 

NOT DONE YET 5) All the data which is used should be available within the project. (e.g. "/homes/agolicz/alignments/alignment1") 

Comments on ColumnCollectionShortList: 
This class is not used any more.

DONE 6) Methods names should be converted to enumeration (java enum). 
cols.calculationInitializtion(kabat, jores, schneider, shenkin, gerstein, taylorNoGaps, taylorGaps, zvelibil, karlin, armon, thompson, lancet, mirny, williamson, landgraf, sander, valdar);
are these the list of supported methods? 

DONE 7) Can initialisation be completed when a particular calculation method is requested? 

DONE 8) Can the result of calculation be stored in memory and if required be written into a file? 
They should not be written into a file to start with. 


DONE  9) Please make sure your methods produce right values. I made a MethodTester class, 
: Tester has three column with three examples. Two extreme(column fully conserved and all but one gaps) 
and one semiconserved column.
there are 3 sequences there, assume that they represent an alignment. Calculate values 
for each method manually, and compare them with what your method gives you. 
Do you think you can do manual calculation for 3 colument with 3 AA each?   

DONE 10) Please indicate which classes are not part of your resulting system, for example by prefixing them 
with underscore. 

11) General recommendation - avoid methods/constructors with more then 5 parameters! 
Talk to me if you feel you cannot get away without them. 

DONE 12) Why AminoAcidMatrix has a constructor with 10 chars? Does it have to be 10 chars? 
Would not it be easier to accept an array of chars of arbitrary length?
Similar goes for Column class. 
(I've changed one of the constructors taking chars as arguments - that one now accepts array of any length, there is another constructor taking chars but this one is used just in test files but I'll keep it as it is for now since it is used for tests only)

DONE 13) If your expected value is defined to the third point after the comma, e.g. -2.072,
then, the difference between expected and actual value must be lesser then 0.001 
In other words you can only expect the value to be rounded to -2.073 or -2.071,
thus delta should be 0.001. Please do not use 0.1 as a uniform delta everywhere in 
your test cases. 

DONE 14) Conservation client help is not sufficiently detailed. From the information below
I cannot figure out how to run the thing. 
   
Method names, output format, input and output file paths are required.
Methods not provided
Format not provided
Input file path not provided.
Output file path not provided.

DONE: 15) Execution of the ConservationClient with no parameters leads to exception  
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:103)
	at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:66)
	at compbio.conservation.ConservationClient.<init>(ConservationClient.java:213)
	at compbio.conservation.ConservationClient.main(ConservationClient.java:272)

DONE 16) According to java naming conventions Enum constrains should be defined in capital case 
with underscore as a separator between words. Please read on java enum naming convention. 

DONE 17) ConservationClient.scores should not be statically defined. As if it is left (not defined statically)
like it is only one client can be run at one time. This is ok for the command line 
client, but we will need to be able to execute conservation prediction methods from java too.  

18) I suggest Format to be defined as enum too.  
WILL DO as soon as I finish ConservationFormatter and I will know what formats are supported(will be dine today)


NEW


19) Usability issue (low priority): From the user point of view, it is not convenient to enter XXX_SCORE all the time
It would be better to enter one word method name. The program should convert input string to appropriate enumeration 
internally. I'd suggest to make method name case insensitive.   

20) If no output is specified what is the point of running the program? I would suggest output to the System.out, 
if no output file was provided

21) I'd suggest to have a default output format - one without the alignment. So if no format is specified, then 
use default. 

22) I'd suggest to simplify output format without alignment to the following:  

# LANDGRAF_SCORE      
0.000 0.33 0.32        
# WILLIAMSON_SCORE
0.094 0.934 0.54

The hash sign, will help you with parsing, basically, hash at the beginning of the line would denote a method name
Space or tab delimit the values.
The exact same output then, can be used with alignment option too.
   
23) Please output the sequences names for the alignment. 

24) I run ConservatiopnClient with the following options 
-m=LANDGRAF_SCORE -i=D:\workspace\AAConservation\test\data\TO1296.fasta.align -o=d:\test.out -f=RESULT_WITH_ALIGNMENT
on the data file available from test\data\TO1296.fasta.align
All score values were 0.000 is this the output you would expect? 

25) Is the output normalized? If so can I get not normalized output? Remember, the main point of having
output normalized is to be able to compare different scores. Can you handle this for negative scores? 

26) How do I request more than one conservation method to be run? 

27) ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException is thrown if the number of letters in one of the sequences 
in the alignment is not the same as in other sequences.   
 
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 327
        at compbio.conservation.AminoAcidMatrix.<init>(AminoAcidMatrix.java:223)
        at compbio.conservation.ConservationClient.<init>(ConservationClient.java:240)
        at compbio.conservation.ConservationClient.main(ConservationClient.java:300)

This is a precondition for all of your conservation analyses, thus you program must insure that 
the input data meets all precondition requirements before embarking on the calculation. 
It would be appropriate to throw IllegalAgrumentException, or even some more specific 
exception if you have created one to indicate that the precondition does not hold. 
The error message should contain sufficient details, so that non technical user can 
have an idea what the problem might be and how to solve it.

28) Exception in thread "main" compbio.conservation.NotAnAminoAcidException: Illegal characetr in the allignment

    Please consider adding the following information to help user to identify the problematic sequence. 
    - sequence name
    - sequence position (optional, do this if its not hard)
    - violating character
    - list of valid characters
    - fix the grammar
Given a large number of sequences in the input, it will be impossible to identify the problem 
by the message which is currently provided.
      
Please review all your error messages asking one question - Is the error message 
sufficiently detailed to identify the problem?

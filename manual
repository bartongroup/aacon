AA Connservation 1.0

This program allows calculation of conservation of amino acids in
multiple sequence alignments.
It implements 15 different conservation scores as described by Valdar in
his paper (Scoring Residue Conservation, PROTEINS: Structure, Function
and Genetics 48:227-241 (2002)) and SMERFS scoring algorithm as described
by Manning, Jefferson and Barton (The contrasting properties of conservation
and correlated phylogeny in protein functional residue prediction,
BMC Bioinformatics (2008)).
The scores supported are:
KABAT, JORES, SCHNEIDER, SHENKIN, GERSTEIN, TAYLOR_GAPS, TAYLOR_NO_GAPS, 
ZVELIBIL, KARLIN, ARMON, THOMPSON, NOT_LANCET, MIRNY, WILLIAMSON, 
LANDGRAF, SANDER, VALDAR, SMERFS

Input format is a FASTA file. By default program prints the results
to the command window. If the output file is provided the results are 
printed to the file in two possible formats (with or without an alignment).
The default format prints the results without alignment.  
The scores can be normalized or not. By default the scores are not 
normalized. If SMERFS is called and no parameters for SMERFS are provided
it is run with the default arguments (window width of 7, column score given to 
the middle column, gap% cutoff of 1.0). If new parameters are needed all
three of them have to be provided. Details of the program execution can
be listed to a separate file if an appropriate file path is provided.
Program accepts command line arguments. All the arguments are preceded by a certain key:
-m= - precedes a comma separated list of method names
      EXAMPLE: -m=KABAT,JORES,GERSTEIN
-i= - precedes a full path to the input FASTA file
-o= - precedes a full path to the output file
-f= - precedes the format  of the results in the output file
      two different formats are possible:
      RESULTS_WITH_ALIGNMENT
      RESULTS_NO_ALIGNMENT
-s= - precedes a list of three comma separated parameters for SMERFS
      the order of parameters is as following:
      1. window width - an integer and an odd number
      2. how to allocate window scores to columns, two ways are possible:
	     MID_SCORE - gives the window score to the middle column
	     MAX_SCORE - gives the column the highest score of all the windows it belongs to
      3. gap percentage cutoff - a float greater than 0 and smaller or equal 1
      EXAMPLE: -s=5,MID_SCORE,0.1
      
-d= - precedes a full path to a file where program execution details are to be listed  
-g= - precedes comma separated list of gap characters provided by the user, if you're using an unusual gap character
      (not a -,., ,*) you have to provide it. If you you provide this list you have to list all the gaps accepted. Including those
      that were previously treated as a default.      
-n - using this key causes the results to be normalized

EXAMPLE HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
-m=KABAT,SMERFS -i=/homes/agolicz/alignments/prot1 -o=/homes/agolicz/alignments/prot1_results 
-f=RESULTS_NO_ALIGNMENT -n

KABAT and SMERFS scores will be calculated. Input will come form /homes/agolicz/alignments/prot1 
file and will be printed to /homes/agolicz/alignments/prot1_results without alignment. 
Results will be normalized between 0 and 1.
To normalize the results n = (d - dmin)/(dmax - dmin) formula is used.
If the results are negative they are first shifted by adding the 
absolute value of the most negative number.
